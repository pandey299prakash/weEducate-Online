                <p class="text-small">The first thing that strikes in our minds when we think about education is gaining
                    knowledge. Education is a tool which provides people with knowledge, skill, technique, information,
                    enables them to know their rights and duties toward their family, society as well as the nation. It
                    expands vision and outlook to see the world. It develops the capabilities to fight against
                    injustice, violence, corruption and many other bad elements in the society.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">“Literacy”, the ability to read and write, is often equated with
                “education”, but is not the same. Literacy is a step to education. For me, education is the complete
                development of a person in terms of knowledge, sensibility and most important, behaviour in different
                situations.Literacy can be forgotten but education cannot. Frederick W. Robertson said, “Instruction
                ends in the school term, but education ends only with life”.The goal of education is not necessarily the
                mastery of a subject but mastery of a person.Education can be defined as the process of learning that
                continues throughout one’s life. It promotes mobilisation of knowledge and contribute to one’s
                development. It helps people develop skills towards jobs and creates productive efficiency.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Evolution of Education</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Over the decades, the school education system of the country has
                undergone a sea-change. The steadily increasing use of technology has inspired child-centric approaches
                and garnered government’s attention on developing a system shaped up in alignment with global-level
                evolution of school education system. How all this has led to imparting of holistic education is worth
                exploration.The modern school education system in India comprising primary, middle and secondary levels
                vary considerably across the States since education is primarily the responsibility of the State
                Governments. Most States follow five years of primary, three years of middle and two years each of
                secondary and higher secondary levels.
                The Indian education system is one of the largest in the world with more than 1.5 million schools, 8.5
                million teachers and 250 million students from varied socio economic backgrounds (Source: Performance
                Grading Index 2017-18 under Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan).

                The system strives to maintain standards and uniformity across the country while giving ample scope for
                the country’s diverse culture and heritage to grow and flourish. In the public schools, the lessons are
                taught mostly in regional languages and English is learned as second language while private schools use
                English to teach most of the subjects.

                To modernise the knowledge delivery ways, schools and teachers are adopting various unique and best
                practices with increased usage of technology as one of them. These methodologies help schools to cater
                to physical and emotional needs of students along with academics.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The main aim of the technical education is that, it makes the students
                skilled and technically fit for the industries. The technical education schemes are having very good
                opportunities for career and employment. It imparts the knowledge strongly from the basics to advanced
                and modern technologies for the budding technical aspirants. The education which provides special
                practical knowledge of technologies and skills is known as technical education. It is different from
                general education. As far as concern the technical education promotes independent and self learning,
                tunes the student effectively and increases the potential of the students. The technical education is
                not about studying and passing of the examinations, but it imparted a technical bias to the electrifying
                today’s students.Technical Education offers good opportunities for employments and it would be helpful
                to make successful career. If we talk about the technical education, it contributes a major share to the
                overall education system and plays an important role in the social and economic development of our
                nation. In India, technical education is imparted at various levels such as: industrial training
                institute, diploma, and degree, post-graduate and research in specialized technical fields,
                accommodating to various aspects of technological development and economic progress.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in ancient India has always been believed to be very
                disciplined and well-organized, dating back to sometime during 3rd century B.C when traditional and
                religious knowledge used to be the main subject of learning. Palm leaves and tree barks were the writing
                pads and most of the teaching was oral by sages and scholars. Education in India became more relevant
                with the Gurukul System of learning that required students and teachers boarding together, passing on
                knowledge generations after generations. Religion, philosophy, warfare, medicine, astrology were the
                main subjects of teaching. Another unique aspect of this education was its free availability for all but
                was allowed a voluntary contribution called ‘Guru Dakshina’ which could mostly be afforded by few
                well-to-do families at the end of the courses.</p>
